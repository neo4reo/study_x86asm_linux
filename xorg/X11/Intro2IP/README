PROJECT DESCRIPTION
    The program Intro2IP is developed for low-level study purpose.
    This program speaks directly with X Server and uses Linux
    Kernel systemcalls. No C Library or any high-level API are used.

    Note that this program uses SSE2 SIMD instructions for extra
    performance when calculating image processing filter.

    The Intro2IP program is licensed under MIT License.


TARGET
    KERNEL       : Linux x86
    ARCHITECTURE : x86 and x86_64
    ASSEMBLER    : NASM
    X SERVER     : 11
    OS           : Fedora 19 and Ubuntu 12.04

REQUIRED EXTERNAL FILES
    No external files needed. Everything are already included in this
    project file.


NOTES

    Minimum Requirement
    - - - - - - - - - -

    1) X Server version 11
    2) Linux Kernel version 3.14 or above.
    3) x86 Intel/AMD CPU or better.
    4) Graphics Memory with 12Mb and above.
    5) RAM 512Mb or above


    How to run this program
    - - - - - - - - - - - -

    STEP 1: Download this project file.
    In case if you don't know how to download a single file from
    Github, use svn command and replace "/tree/master/" with "/trunk/"
    like this:
        $ svn checkout https://github.com/nikAizuddin/research_x86asm/trunk/xorg/X11/Intro2IP

    STEP 2: Compile this project file.
    You can skip this STEP 2 because i'm already include the exe
    file, but you may want to compile the source code on your own.
    Make sure you have already installed NASM Assembler to compile.
    Just use this command to compile the source code:
        $ make

    STEP 3:
    Run the program using this command:
        $ ./Intro2IP

    When running the program press "F1" for Help.
    If you have any problem or suggestion about this program,
    let me know :) This is my first time writing a low-level
    program like this.
